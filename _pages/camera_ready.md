title: "Camera Ready Submission"
---

<p>Camera-ready material must be submitted by Friday, ***28 July, 2023***. You must upload all files as a single zipped file of 350 MB or less, which is the limit imposed by the CMT system. Please use the "submit camera-ready file" link on your CMT user dashboard.</p>
<p>Before submission, please ensure that you have addressed the minor changes provided by the reviewers and included a file named 'Changes after review' that lists all modifications made to the paper. You must also identify a corresponding author who will be responsible for carrying out the final proof check of the paper. Springer will contact the corresponding author approximately three weeks before the conference and provide a 72-hour time slot for this purpose. If you have multiple corresponding authors, please refer to the <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-FAQ.html">FAQ page</a>.</p>
<p>The corresponding author must sign the copyright form available at <a href="mlcnworkshop/mlcnworkshop.github.io/files/MLCN2023_ProceedingsPaper_LTP.docx">this link</a>. Please note that digital signatures are not acceptable. You must upload the camera-ready copy of your paper with all figures and the signed copyright form in a single zip file. Please refer to the checklist below for a list of required files.</p>
<p>The LNCS templates available on the Springer website must be used to prepare your paper, which must adhere to the formatting rules specified. Please note that colored figures will be printed in black and white, so please ensure that they remain comprehensible. Springer's format for bibliographical references must be strictly enforced. Additionally, please make sure that if the same author appears on multiple papers, their name appears in the same form on all papers, consistent with the form used in the author list submitted to CMT.</p>
<p>If you are using LaTeX, please insert a line % index{Last Name, First Name} for every author of the paper, immediately after the author{} command. This will allow us to create an author index in the proceedings. Please also make sure that we parse authors' names into the last name and the first name correctly, particularly for authors with more than two words in their full names.</p>
<p>The final version of your paper may expand up to 8½ pages (including figures and tables) + 2 pages for references to accommodate additional content that Springer will add to your paper to link to your supplementary material, leaving room for additional Springer content/formatting on the bottom half of page 11. Please ensure that the order of the authors on your paper is the same as that entered into CMT.</p>
<p>The proceedings will be published as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) in both electronic and paper versions by Springer. Please read carefully the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">information for authors</a> from Springer.</p>
