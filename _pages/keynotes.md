Dr. Neda Jahanshad received a PhD from UCLA’s Biomedical Engineering department in the Medical Imaging Informatics track, and before that, received undergraduate degrees from Johns Hopkins University in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering. Neda is now at the University of Southern California as an Associate Professor of Neurology and Biomedical Engineering at the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute with an affiliation at the Information Sciences Institute. Neda’s work bridges informatics, data science and engineering with neurology and psychiatry through large scale studies of multimodal neuroimaging. 
<br>
<br>
Dr. Jahanshad is director of USC’s Laboratory of Brain eScience and associate director of the international neuroimaging consortium, ENIGMA, which conducts harmonized analyses across tens to hundreds of datasets worldwide to reliably study the brain in health and disease as observed using neuroimaging. 
<br>
<br>
Dr. Jahanshad’s research focus is on developing tools and algorithms to assess brain structure, microstructure, and connectivity throughout the lifespan, determining genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the variability in brain connections, risk for brain dysfunctions, and outcomes for people with mental illnesses, developmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and dementias.
