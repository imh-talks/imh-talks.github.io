## Prof. Catie Chang
<img align="left" src="https://mlcnworkshop.github.io/images/chang.jpg" width="400 px" style="padding: 10px">Catie Chang is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University, and is the Sally and Dave Hopkins Faculty Fellow. She received her Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University, following undergraduate studies at MIT. She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. At Vanderbilt, Catie is principal investigator of the Neuroimaging and Brain Dynamics Lab, which develops engineering and computational methods for understanding the human brain. Her work draws upon signal processing and machine learning techniques to uncover information from dynamic measurements of brain activity.

Dr. Neda Jahanshad received a PhD from UCLA’s Biomedical Engineering department in the Medical Imaging Informatics track, and before that, received undergraduate degrees from Johns Hopkins University in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering. Neda is now at the University of Southern California as an Associate Professor of Neurology and Biomedical Engineering at the USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute with an affiliation at the Information Sciences Institute. Neda’s work bridges informatics, data science and engineering with neurology and psychiatry through large scale studies of multimodal neuroimaging. 
<br>
<br>
Dr. Jahanshad is director of USC’s Laboratory of Brain eScience and associate director of the international neuroimaging consortium, ENIGMA, which conducts harmonized analyses across tens to hundreds of datasets worldwide to reliably study the brain in health and disease as observed using neuroimaging. 
<br>
<br>
Dr. Jahanshad’s research focus is on developing tools and algorithms to assess brain structure, microstructure, and connectivity throughout the lifespan, determining genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the variability in brain connections, risk for brain dysfunctions, and outcomes for people with mental illnesses, developmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and dementias.
