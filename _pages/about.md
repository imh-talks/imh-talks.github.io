In this international workshop on ***Machine Learning in Clinical Neuroimaging*** (MLCN) we bring together top researchers in machine learning, neuroscience and tech-savvy clinicians to address two main challenges: i) development of methodological approaches for analyzing complex neuroimaging data and ii) filling the translational gap in applying existing machine learning methods in clinical practice. You can find the [MLCN proceedings of the last years](https://link.springer.com/conference/mlcn) here and some of the recordings on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7RKhS5bHKiuYXdaBolX6Og).

This year's workshop in Marocco will be hybrid, thus you can participate in Marrrakesh or from home. Please follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MLCNworkshop) and check out our [submission & registration](https://mlcnworkshop.github.io/submission_registration/) if you like to submit a paper or attend the workshop.

We are looking forward to seeing you @ this year's workshop!
