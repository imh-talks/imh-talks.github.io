## Call for Papers -> BEST PAPER(S) AWARD 1500 USD 

In the ***Machine Learning track***, we are seeking novel contributions that address current methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous clinical neuroscientific data using stable, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models.

In the ***Clinical Neuroimaging track***, we are interested in papers with an applied focus. We invite the community to submit conference contributions on machine learning approaches aimed at improving our understanding of complex brain disorders and moving the field closer to precision medicine.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>Big data</li>
    <li>Spatio-temporal brain data analysis</li>
    <li>Structural data analysis</li>
    <li>Graph theory and complex network analysis</li>
    <li>Longitudinal data analysis</li>
    <li>Model stability and interpretability</li>
    <li>Model scalability in large neuroimaging datasets</li>
    <li>Multi-source data integration and multi-view learning</li>
    <li>Multi-site data analysis, from preprocessing to modeling</li>
    <li>Domain adaptation, data harmonization, and transfer learning in neuroimaging</li>
    <li>Unsupervised methods for stratifying brain disorders</li>
    <li>Deep learning in clinical neuroimaging</li>
    <li>Model uncertainty in clinical predictions</li>
    <li>Biomarker discovery</li>
    <li>Refinement of nosology and diagnostics</li>
    <li>Biological validation of clinical syndromes</li>
    <li>Treatment outcome prediction</li>
    <li>Course prediction</li>
    <li>Analysis of wearable sensors</li>
    <li>Neurogenetics and brain imaging genetics</li>
    <li>Mechanistic modeling</li>
    <li>Brain aging</li>
    <li>Database for machine learning</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>

## Submission Requirements & Process:

To submit your work to the workshop, please ensure that it meets the following requirements:
<ul>
    <li>The submission should be high-quality, original, and unpublished work that addresses one or more of the challenges outlined by the workshop below.</li>
    <li>The submission should be in electronic format and adhere to Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style, which includes detailed author guidelines available at this <a href="https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/PAPER-SUBMISSION-AND-REBUTTAL-GUIDELINES.html#manuscriptpreparation">link</a>.</li>
    <li>The submission should be made through the CMT system, which can be accessed <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/MLCN2023">here</a>. Please note that we use a double-blind review process, and therefore, submissions must be anonymous.</li>
    <li>The submission should not exceed a total of 8 pages, including figures, tables, and text. An additional 2 pages of references are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your paper is accepted, it will be published in a joint proceeding with the MICCAI 2023 conference. Once accepted, you will need to prepare a camera-ready submission according to the guidelines provided at this <a href="https://mlcnworkshop.github.io/camera_ready">link</a>.</p>
