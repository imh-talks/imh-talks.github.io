## Call for Papers 

<img align="center" src="https://mlcnworkshop.github.io/images/pic3_PaperSubmissions.png" width="1000 px" style="padding: 10px">

In the ***Machine Learning track***, we are seeking novel contributions that address current methodological gaps in analyzing high-dimensional, longitudinal, and heterogeneous clinical neuroscientific data using stable, scalable, and interpretable machine learning models.

In the ***Clinical Neuroimaging track***, we are interested in papers with an applied focus. We invite the community to submit conference contributions on machine learning approaches aimed at improving our understanding of complex brain disorders and moving the field closer to precision medicine.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
<ul>
    <li>Big data</li>
    <li>Spatio-temporal brain data analysis</li>
    <li>Structural data analysis</li>
    <li>Graph theory and complex network analysis</li>
    <li>Longitudinal data analysis</li>
    <li>Model stability and interpretability</li>
    <li>Model scalability in large neuroimaging datasets</li>
    <li>Multi-source data integration and multi-view learning</li>
    <li>Multi-site data analysis, from preprocessing to modeling</li>
    <li>Domain adaptation, data harmonization, and transfer learning in neuroimaging</li>
