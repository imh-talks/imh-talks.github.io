### KEYNOTE - Islem Rekik

***Talk title: Cognitive Alchemy: Merging AI with the Brain's Blueprint***
<br>
Abstract: This keynote explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, in particular graph neural networks (GNNs) and neuroscience, focusing on the innovative use of generative GNNs to map the brain connectome. Conversely, the brain's intricate architecture and cognitive capacities offer invaluable inspiration to refine and evolve GNNs. The talk will explore the reciprocal relationship between AI and neuroscience, showcasing pioneering models that generate brain networks while simultaneously advancing the capabilities of GNNs. AI for brains, brains for AIâ€”or both?
