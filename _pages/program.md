***TALK AI/ML for continuously larger scale international neuroimaging research***
Large-scale neuroimaging collaborations have been established to help tackle the reproducibility crisis in brain imaging research. These collaborations often involved dozens of research groups pooling together neuroimaging, clinical and computational resources together to amass study sample sizes on the order of tens of thousands of participants. However, data sharing and data heterogeneity remain necessary and important hurdles on the path towards efficient data analysis. Here, we will discuss common clinical and technical challenges faced when working with distributed and diverse data as well as the collaborative and neuroinformatic backbone of these collaborations. The discussion will emphasize the growing role that machine learning and artificial intelligence are playing, and will play, in multiple aspects of collaborative neurosciences. In this talk, the methods and applications discussed will be in the context of the ENIGMA consortium, but these may be applicable across many multi-site collaborative studies.
