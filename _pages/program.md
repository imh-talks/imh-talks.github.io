### KEYNOTE - Udunna Anazodo

***Title: Can We Use Small Data to Solve Big Clinical Neuroimaging Problems?***
<br>
Abstract: In June 2014, an article was published in the journal of Brain Imaging and Behaviour, entitled 'Human Neuroimaging as a "Big Data" Science'. Arguably, the general idea a decade ago that still continues today, is that the bigger the brain imaging data, the closer we can get to understand the varying and complex biological processes that underlie neurological disorders. While many big data initiatives have been created to provide thousands of neuroimaging dataset (e.g., these Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative), these initiatives are challenging to implement in resource-constrained settings, particularly in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). The lack of neuroimaging and computational infrastructure, skilled personnel, and local funding limits sustainable big data initiatives in LMICs. Can well-structured smaller datasets drawn from local LMIC populations provide meaningful insights to clinical neuroimaging problems? This talk will kickstart conversations on the value of small data and showcase its potential use in addressing clinical neuroimaging challenges in LMICs. 

### KEYNOTE - Islem Rekik

***Talk title: Cognitive Alchemy: Merging AI with the Brain's Blueprint***
<br>
Abstract: This keynote explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, in particular graph neural networks (GNNs) and neuroscience, focusing on the innovative use of generative GNNs to map the brain connectome. Conversely, the brain's intricate architecture and cognitive capacities offer invaluable inspiration to refine and evolve GNNs. The talk will explore the reciprocal relationship between AI and neuroscience, showcasing pioneering models that generate brain networks while simultaneously advancing the capabilities of GNNs. AI for brains, brains for AIâ€”or both?
